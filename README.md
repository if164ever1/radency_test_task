# radency_test_task

Tasks to be performed in C#
During the interview, you are asked to create a program that checks whether a given string S can be formed from two other strings: P1 and P2.
The condition is that the characters in P1 and P2 must be in the same order as in S.
The interviewer gives you the following example:

'radency' can be formed with 'rdnc' and 'aey':
S: r a d n c y = radency
P1: r d n c = rdnc
P2: a e y = aey
